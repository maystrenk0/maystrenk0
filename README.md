## Projects

### Project 1: Sport Highlights Generator
My project about emotional and substantive content analysis won a third place at HACKA-CON by MEGOGO & PariMatch Tech (Dec 2021). I used voice recognition and keywords dicts to choose the most interesting moments of football match, then highlights were combined in a compilation.
